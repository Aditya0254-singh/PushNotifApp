Push Notification App â€“ React Native + Firebase (FCM)

ðŸ“± Project Overview

This project is a simple React Native app that demonstrates **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** push notifications using `@react-native-firebase/messaging`. When the app is launched, it requests notification permissions, retrieves the device's FCM token, and listens for foreground push messages.

## Features

- Request and display FCM token on app start.
- Handle incoming notifications in the foreground with `Alert.alert`.
- Integrated with Firebase using `google-services.json`.

## Tech Stack

- React Native (v0.80)
- TypeScript
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Android Emulator (Pixel 7a)
- Firebase Console

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or unzip the project folder.

2. Install dependencies.

3. Run the Android app.

4. Allow permissions and note the FCM token in the terminal output or log.

5. You will see a pop-up notification in the emulator/app with the title.
